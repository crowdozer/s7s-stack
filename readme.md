# S7S (aka "stackless") Stack

A Svelte-Kit template repo featuring:

- 🔐 End-to-End type safety (DB to Client!) 
- 📡 User auth available at the Edge with ZERO network requests 
- 🐛Strict environment checks that fail during build time, not runtime! 
- 💾 A clean and sensible file structure 
- ✨ Tailwind CSS pre-configured 

### Important:

This is WIP and has no dedicated full time maintainer. In theory, because it's mostly Svelte-Kit with tRPC and some inferred typing, unforseen circumstances should be trivial to fix.

 However, you should still apply discretion before using this for a major project. 
 
 PR's are welcome.
