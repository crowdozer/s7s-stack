/**
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *             PREFACE - READ THIS FIRST
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You *probably* don't need to edit this file unless:
 *
 * 1. You need to add extra CONTEXT to each REQUEST     (section #1)
 * 2. You need to customize the tRPC SERVER             (section #2)
 * 3. You need to create a custom tRPC PROCEDURE        (section #3)
 *
 * If that sounded foreign, then you can safely leave this file alone =)
 *
 * SUMMARY:
 * This file is a configuration and utility file for tRPC, a strongly typed API
 * layer for backend communication. It provides the means to create contexts for the API,
 * define guards for secure procedures, and handle errors. It also contains several utility
 * types to help you set up and manage guards, request context, and procedure execution.
 *
 * 1. CONTEXT:
 * This section defines the "contexts" available in the backend API.
 * Contexts allow you to access resources like databases or sessions when
 * processing a request. The createContext function returns an object containing
 * the request event and an instance of Prisma (an ORM used to interact with databases).
 *
 * 2. tRPC API:
 * This section initializes the tRPC API, connects the context and transformer,
 * and sets up error handling. The initTRPC function initializes the tRPC API with the
 * context created earlier. The createTRPCRouter function is an export that helps create
 * tRPC routers in the application.
 *
 * 3. tRPC Procedures:
 * This section provides utilities for creating tRPC procedures,
 * guards, and protected procedures. The procedure export allows you to build new
 * queries and mutations for your tRPC API. The guardedProcedure function is used
 * to create protected procedures that require a series of guards to pass before
 * executing the procedure.
