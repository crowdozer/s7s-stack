/**
 * S3 Comment:
 * This is where server hooks are defined. This stack uses the
 * Handle hook to inject context into every request. 
 * 
 * It's fine to extend this behavior, but make sure you define it: 
 * `src/app.d.ts`
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * The order of events matters! Handlers apply synchronously.
